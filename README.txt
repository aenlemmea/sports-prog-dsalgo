==================


Data Structures and Algorithms for Sports
Programming. 
Mostly meant to be code samples so that 
I remember most concepts, *intuitively*.
No intentions of writing the most optimised
code here.

JDK Language Level - 1.8

1. The `ds` package in `src/main/java/ana/lemma` 
    has the data structures.
2. The `templates` folder has my (unsuccessful) 
    attempts at curating/trying various fast
    I/O templates for Java.
